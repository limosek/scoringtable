# Scoring table for (not only) floorball players
This is result of my work to make scoring table for our team. Thanks to Rostislav Kolar for HW design.
It uses one big scoring table and small device for increment/decrement score connected by cable.
Main purpose of it is to demonstrate what is possible to do with sdcc and small PIC devices.

Feel free to use :)

## Schema

Schema is explained in png files. There are two boxes. One sender with buttons and another receiver (table) with LCD segments.
